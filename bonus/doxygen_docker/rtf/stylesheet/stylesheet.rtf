\par \fs24\ul Introduction\ulnone \fs22\par
The Zappy project is a game consisting of an AI (in the language we whish) a Graphical interface (in cpp) and a server (in c)\par

\par \fs24\ul Implementation\ulnone \fs22\par
This is a very challenging project because it asks us to rely on what we have learned during the current year in order to complete the project\par
Never the less, you can find compiled binaries for Linus (x86 bits) Mac (Intel chip) and Mac (Apple Silicon) binaries available so that you can test the program\par 

\par \fs24\ul Conclusion\ulnone \fs22\par
Overall We hope you will like the project and it's outcome.\par
The ideas that made this project possible are all thanks to EPITECH (epitech.eu) who asked us to create such an interesting game, thus the base idea belongs to them\par
